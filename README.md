# Discord Nuke Bot ðŸ’€

This Discord bot is designed for a specific purpose: to quickly and dramatically alter a Discord server by deleting all existing channels and roles, then creating a large number of new channels and roles. This can be useful for testing server resilience, creating chaos for fun, or any other scenario where you need to drastically change the server's structure.



> [!note]  
> This bot should be used with caution and only in servers where you have permission to make such drastic changes. It is recommended to use this bot in a controlled environment or on a server dedicated for testing purposes.

## Features

- Nuke command to delete all channels, create new channels, and modify roles.
- Customizable settings for channel names, role names, and batch sizes.
- Integration with the Discord API to perform actions efficiently.


> [!IMPORTANT]
